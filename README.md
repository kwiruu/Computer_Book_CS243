# Assembly NASM x86 CS243 CIT-U Activities Repository

Welcome to my Assembly NASM x86 repository! This repository contains the projects and activities I've worked on during my Computer Science studies at the university. Here, I explore the world of low-level programming using NASM (Netwide Assembler) for x86 architecture.

## Introduction
In this repository, you'll find a collection of assembly programs and projects that demonstrate my understanding of the x86 architecture and low-level programming concepts. Each project is a reflection of my journey through the Computer Science curriculum.

## Projects
1. **Project Name 1**
   - Brief description of the project and its purpose.
   - Any special features or challenges tackled.

2. **Project Name 2**
   - Brief description of the project and its purpose.

## How to Run
Include instructions on how to build and run your assembly programs. Provide any prerequisites, tools, or dependencies needed for successful execution.

```bash
# Example instructions for running a program
nasm -f elf32 your_program.asm -o your_program.o
gcc -m32 your_program.o -o your_program
./your_program
